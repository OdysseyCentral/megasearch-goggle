# Odyssey Central Mega Search

The comprehensive search engine for *Adventures in Odyssey* fans!

## What is this?

Using the [Brave Search API](https://brave.com/search/api/) and [Brave Search Goggles](https://github.com/brave/goggles-quickstart), users can easily search the internet with a focus on *Odyssey*-related results, or completely limit their query to those websites in the *Odyssey Central* Mega Search database.

This repo includes Brave Search Goggles for Odyssey Central Mega Search and some of the code for the Odyssey Central Mega Search API (Mega Search API).

The Mega Search API consists of a superset of the Brave Search API, a superset of the AIOWiki (MediaWiki) search API, a superset of the AIO Club search API, data source lists (lists of websites to include and use in the API), as well as integration code for the rest of *Odyssey Central*.
